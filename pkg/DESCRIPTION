Description: Algorithm to process hierarchical clustering on individuals
    (from a matrix individuals x variables). The dissimilarity used
    in the observation space is the log-likelihood ratio, i.e.
    D(i,j) = log f(Y_i) + log f(Y_j) - log f(Y_i U Y_j)
    where Y_i is the vector of observations from individual i.
    The statistical model defining the considered likelihood is
    standard Gaussian or Zero-Inflated Gaussian (i.e. a Gaussian-Bernoulli
    mixture). The agglomeration method is also the log-likelihood ratio,
    however between clusters in this case.
